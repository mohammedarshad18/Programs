/*
In the above program, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number and that
number is stored in place of the larger number.
Here, n1 -= n2 is the same as n1 = n1 - n2. Similarly, n2 -= n1 is the same as n2 = n2 -
n1.
This process is continued until the two numbers become equal which will be HCF.
Let us look at how this program works when n1 = 16 and n2 = 76.
n1 n2  n1>n2 n1-=n2  n2-=n1  n1!=n2
16 76  false   -       60     true
16 60  false   -       44     true
16 44  false   -       28     true
16 28  false   -       12     true
16 12  true    4        -     true
4  12  false   -       8      true
4  8   false   -       4      false
Here, the loop terminates when n1 != n2 becomes false.
After the final iteration of the loop, n1 = n2 = 4. This is the value of the GCD/HCF since
this is the greatest number that can divide both 16 and 76.
